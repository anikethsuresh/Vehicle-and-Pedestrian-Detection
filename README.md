# Vehicle-and-Pedestrian-Detection
Detection of Vehicles and Pedestrians using YOLOV3

This repository used yolov3 to perform object detection, followed by a simple method of object tracking to detect objects across frames.

Dependencies:
cvlib
tensorflow
numpy

The datasets that could be used can be found here:

Prefereably run this code on video taken at 30fps (performs poorly on lower fps).
